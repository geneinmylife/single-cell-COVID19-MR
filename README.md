This repository contains code for immune cell-specific eQTL Mendelian randomization(MR) in different types of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we identified 132 putative causal genes across 14 immune-cell types for four types of COVID-19 infection. Through a systematic evaluation of the 58 novel causal genes, 37 of them showed the potential to be considered as promising targets for COVID-19. Our study  identified novel immune-mediated causal genes and pathways for COVID-19 and provides a novel tier system to prioritize immune-related drug targets for COVID-19.

To start using the code, you need to install several packages which have been listed on each code

The following code were used in this study:

1. All process in COVID-19 vs.population(C2). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(C2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

2. All process in hospitalized COVID-19 vs.non-hospitalized  COVID-19 (B1). R:  To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(B1) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

3. All process in hospitalized COVID-19 vs.population(B2). R:  To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(B2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

4. All process in very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 vs.population(A2). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(A2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

5. All process in Long COVID MR analysis.

6. Debiased Inverse-Variance Weighted(dIVW) and penalized inverse-variance weighted(pIVW) MR.

7. Differential expression analysis(DEG) analysis from sc-seq data

8. Two-step MR r code for mediation analysis.

9. Tissue specific MR from GTEx.
