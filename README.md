# single-cell-COVID19-MR
This repository contains code for immune cell-specific eQTL-Mendelian randomization in different types of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we identified 132 putative causal genes across 14 immune-cell types for four types of COVID-19 infection. Through a systematic evaluation of the 58 novel causal genes, 37 of them showed the potential to be considered as promising targets for COVID-19. Our study identified novel immune-mediated causal genes and pathways for COVID-19 and provides a novel tier system to prioritize immune-related drug targets for COVID-19.

To start using the code, you need to install several packages which have been listed on each code

The following code were used in this study:

all process in COVID-19 vs.population(C2). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(C2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

all process in hospitalized COVID-19 vs.non-hospitalized COVID-19 (B1). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(B1) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

all process in hospitalized COVID-19 vs.population(B2). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(B2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.

all process in very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 vs.population(A2). R: To identify putative causal genes for covid-19 in the COVID-19 vs.population(A2) group and subsequently investigate how these genes functions.
